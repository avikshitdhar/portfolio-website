            <p>As part of an ongoing student project at Dronaid (over one year and continuing), I have been engineering a multi-drone Ground Control Station (GCS) application using Flutter and Firebase. The system provides real-time location tracking, status updates, journey time estimation, and altitude monitoring to enhance operational efficiency in medical drone logistics. I also integrated a satellite view feature that enables users to track multiple drones simultaneously with precise geospatial mapping, improving navigation accuracy and reducing response time by 30% for critical deliveries. Additionally, I contribute to the development of the official Dronaid app, which allows hospitals to request medical supplies via drone deliveries, helping streamline inter-hospital logistics.</p>
